# Dining Data - Emerging Digital Academy Solo Project

This is a repository containing my Solo Project for Emerging Digital Academy showcasing what we have learned in our 20 week full stack javascript coding academy. The main goal of the project is to make the management of beer and wine lists more manageable at restaurants, bars, breweries, or any food and beverage concept. It allows authorized users access to lists of items in that concepts database. The user is then able to view, add, edit or delete items from beer, wine or vendor lists. Admins are able to assign admin capability or delete users no longer employed with that concept. 

## Get Everything Up and Running

1. `npm install` will install all necessary dependencies for React, React-Redux, Redux-Sagas, Axios, DotEnv, Express, Passport
2. `npm install bootstrap@5.2.3` to add Bootstrap
3. `npm install --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core` to add Font Awesome for icons
4. `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled` for Material UI Search Form.
5. `npm run server` to run the server on port 5001.
6. `npm run client` to run the React app on port 5173.

This version uses React, Redux, Express, Passport, and PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).
